# ruby-hangman
My fourth OOP project made with Ruby for my Odin Project journey (TOP)
This project is a faithful recreation of the classical game of Hangman, with some additional features like saving and loading a game. When starting a new game, you will receive a word to guess starting from blank. You can guess the individual letters by typing the letter itself, the correct guess will replace one of the blank spots, while bad guesses will be counted as mistakes. If you commit too much mistakes, the game will be over! If you want to use the saving and loading features, type "save" when guessing to save the current game save, type "load_save" to load the latest saved game.
